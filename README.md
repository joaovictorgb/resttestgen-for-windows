# RestTestGen v2 Beta

A framework for automated black-box testing of RESTful APIs.

> **v2:** this is a re-implementation of the original tool proposed by our research team in 2020. This new version is implemented as a framework that allows researchers and practitioners to implement their own testing strategy on top of our [core](#core-features). Testing strategies presented in our papers are included, and available in the `io.resttestgen.implementation` package.

> **Beta research prototype:** this tool is a research prototype in beta version, so you may experience limitations or unexpected behaviours during testing. Please report bugs using the GitHub issue tracker.

> **Citing our work:** please cite our latest journal paper about RestTestGen: *Automated Black-Box Testing of Nominal and Error Scenarios in RESTful APIs*. BibTeX:

## Requirements
- Java 11
- Ubuntu, or other Linux distributions (RestTestGen was not tested on Windows)

## Configuration
RestTestGen comes with a built-in default configuration suitable for most REST APIs, defined in the `io.resttestgen.core.Configuration` class. The default configuration can be overridden by means of the `rtg_config.json` file. The file must be located in the current working directory.

Configurable preferences:
- `logVerbosity`: the verbosity of the log. Can be `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, or `ERROR` (default: `INFO`)
- `testingSessionName`: the name of the testing session printed in the report files (default: `test-session-CURRENT_TIME`)
- `outputPath`: the path in which output data is written (default: `output/`)
- `specificationFileName`: the file name of the input OpenAPI specification (default: `openapi.json`)
- `authCommand`: command to be run to gather information about authentication. See [Authentication](#auth) (default: none)
- `strategyName`: the name of the testing strategy class to be run. `NominalAndErrorStrategy` or your own strategy class (default: `NominalAndErrorStrategy`)
- `qualifiableNames`: list of parameter names to be qualified. E.g., `id` -> `petId`, `name` -> `petName` (default: `['id', 'name']`)
- `odgFileName`: output file name for the operation dependency graph (default: `odg.dot`)

We suggest to override only the strictly necessary preferences, typically the file name of the OpenAPI specification, and the authentication command.

Specific preferences to the nominal and error testing strategy are at the moment only customizable in the source code.

Example of a configuration file (`rtg_config.json`):
```
{
  "specificationFileName": "path/to/my/specification.json",
  "authCommand": "python auth.py",
  "strategyName": "NominalAndErrorStrategy",
  "testingSessionName": "customNameForTestingSession",
  "outputPath": "output/"
}
```

### <a id="auth"></a>Authentication
> (skip if your REST API does not require authentication)

RestRestGen supports authenticated REST APIs. To gather authentication information, RestTestGen runs the authentication command (if provided in the configuration), whose output is expected to be a JSON array. Objects in the array are authentication parameters: they have a name, a value, a location (header, query, etc.), and a timeout (the authentication command will be re-executed, e.g., to gather a new token, after the timeout). The current version of RestTestGen only supports 1 parameter (the first one in the array). Other parameters are currently ignored.


Example of the output of the authentication command:
```
[
  {
    "name": "Authorization",
    "value": "Bearer [TOKEN]",
    "in": "header",
    "timeout": 600
  }
]
```
This output is generated by an example python script `auth.py`, which authenticates a user with the REST API through HTTP interactions. In this example the authentication command for RestTestGen is `python path/to/auth.py`.

## Building and running RestTestGen
To build and run RestTestGen with Gradle use the command: `./gradlew run`

Alternatively, you can open the RestTestGen Gradle project with IntelliJ IDEA. To run RestTestGen, click the play icon alongside the `main` method of the class `io.resttestgen.core.cli.App`.

## <a id="core-features"></a> Features
The core of the RestTestGen framework provides the following features:
- custom parser for OpenAPI specifications v3 in JSON format (we dropped Swagger Codegen that caused instability)
  - please convert Swagger 2.0 files or YAML specifications to JSON v3 specification using [https://editor.swagger.io/](https://editor.swagger.io/)
  - combined parameter schemas (OneOf, AllOf, AnyOf) are supported by the parser, but currently not used in our strategies (wip)
- the Operation Dependency Graph (ODG), that models data dependency among operations
- dictionaries storing values observed at testing time
- smart parameter management using hierarchical data structures
  - these data structures are automatically converted to HTTP requests
- fuzzers to generate parameter values
- mutation operators
  - data type mutation operator
  - missing required mutation operator
  - constraint violation mutation operator
- response processors to elaborate responses
- operations sorters to provide customized operations testing ordering
  - random sorter
  - ODG-based dynamic sorter
- oracles to evaluate test executions
  - nominal status code oracle
  - error status code oracle
  - schema validation oracle (wip)
- writers to output test cases and test results to file
  - JSON report writer
  - JUnit + OkHttp test case writer (wip)
  - JUnit + REST Assured test case writer (wip)
- coverage measurements
  - operations coverage (wip)
  - status code coverage (wip)
